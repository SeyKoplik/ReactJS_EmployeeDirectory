## Description
Employee Directory created with React using components to break up the application's user interface, manage component states, and respond to user events.

Allows a user to view entire directory when page loads and then sort through the criterias available and render a result dynamically while typing in the input box a certain search query.

The use of components and setting states is primarily used to be able to make changes happen as the user interacts with the page and .map() and .filter() functions are used to loop around the results of the query as requested.
